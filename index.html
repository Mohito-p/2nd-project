<h1>CRUD WITH VANILLA JAVACRIPT</h1>
<img src="image 1.jfif" alt="image 1" width="50%">
<p>Being a developer you must have come to a point of wanting to 
    Create, Read, Update, and Delete data when building a web or mobile
    application.
 Things like arrays and objects are there to hold the user dynamic
    data. Being able to store and Update this data is very important to
    take proper control over what happens with the data
    
    On this, you are going to see and learn how to perform a CRUD
         operation on the form input data with a Product_List_App we are 
         going to be building using vanilla JavaScript
    Let us create our product_List_App files. You may use any of
         your preferred HTML editors, but I am using visual studio code
         (vscode) on this course.
On your editor open a new folder, name it Product_List_App,
         inside it create a file, name it product.html. Go inside the 
         HTML file we created above to add this;</p>
<img src="image 2.png" alt="image2" width="50%"><br>   
<h6>HTML file for the production list app</h6>
<p>Above we have created an HTML file, opened a form, and add our 
    inputs for user values, I also added a placeholder and name attribute
     to the input elements for proper clarification. In the input elements,
      an id attribute was added also which will give us the power to get 
      the values of the input elements dynamically.elements dynamically.

        We also added the table element that will hold all of our products
        , a table head element, and a table body was created which will be 
        dynamically added values to.
        Just before the closing body tag, a script tag that holds 
            an SRC attribute that holds the path to our JavaScript files 
            was also added, this is because we will be using an external 
            JavaScript file in the building of this project. This is the 
            browser view of the HTML file above.</p>  
    
            <img src="image 3.png" alt="image 3" width="50%">
            <h6>The browser look of the HTML</h6>
            <p>
                A bit of CSS styling was added to make things look nice and concise.
            
            Inside the Product_List_App folder, we have created, 
                create a JavaScript file, name it product.js. Inside it 
                is where we will be having all of our algorithms for the 
                Product_List_App
                
                    At this point, your folder should contain the product.
                    html and product.js respectively. Now let us declare all
                     our global variables. Go inside the product.js file we 
                     have created to add this;    
                </p>
                
                <img src="image 4.png" alt="image4" width="50%">
                
                <p>Going further we will be having eight functions to
                     play around with. These functions will be as follows;
                    </p>
                    
                    <ul>
                     
                        <li>createItem function,</li>   
                        <li>totalPrice function,</li>
                        <li>tablehead function,</li>
                        <li>tablebody function,</li>
                        <li>readitem function,</li>
                        <li>table function </li>
                        <li>updateItem function </li>
                        <li>deleteItem function,</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h2>C-Creating the products</h2>
                    <p>
            Now let us head to the createItem function, below the global variable we have created, let us add the createItem function.  
</p>
<img src="image5.png" alt="this is image 5" width="50%">
 <p>Up there, we have declared all of the function variables, the document.querySelector is used to get all there values respectively. Due to our hunt to store all those values and being able to play around with it, the values were set to come out as an object and now push the object into the array we declared in our global variables above.

                        The createItem function is executed in the create item button in the HTML file we have created.</p>
